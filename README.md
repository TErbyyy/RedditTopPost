Hi to everyone who is watching my Code:)
My project not perfect at all, because it was my first time when i worked with android studio.
I get a lot of new knowledge because everything what i did was in first time and i was trying my best to complete everything.
All information i get from different forums and trying to put everything in one project.

OK right now about what i didnt solve
1)There isnt working method which should save your image in memory idk why be honestly)
2)And i dont know why resolution of images so bad
